Scenario #2
Let's walk through the Git commands that go along with each step in the scenario you just observed in the video.

Step 1: You check your commit history, seeing messages about the changes you made and how well the code performed.
View the log history
git log

Step 2: The model at this commit seemed to score the highest, so you decide to take a look.
Check out a commit
git checkout bc90f2cbc9dc4e802b46e7a153aa106dc9a88560

After inspecting your code, you realize what modifications made it perform well, and use those for your model.

Step 3: Now, you're confident merging your changes back into the development branch and pushing the updated recommendation engine.
Switch to the develop branch
git checkout develop

Merge the friend_groups branch into the develop branch
git merge --no-ff friend_groups

Push your changes to the remote repository
git push origin develop
