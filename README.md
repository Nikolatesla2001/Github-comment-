GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.

GitHub.com
Development of the GitHub.com platform began on October 19, 2007.[11][12][13] The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta release.[14]

Organizational structure
GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" (self-management).[15] Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but salaries were set by the chief executive.[16][needs update]
